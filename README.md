# Data 22 Star Wars Project (Josh Blackmore)

## Provided Instructions
The character data in your MongoDB database has been pulled from https://swapi.dev/. As well as 'people', the API has data on starships. Using Python, write code to pull data on all available starships from the API. The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into their own collection in MongoDB. (Make sure you drop any existing starships collections.)


## Usage
